## Welcome to the Institute for Complex Systems

The Institute for Complex Systems (ICS) targets the ever-increasing complexity of hardware/software systems. Here, the institute considers suitable abstraction levels, i.e. Virtual Prototypes (VPs) in SystemC for HW/SW systems at the Electronic System Level (ESL), HW designs in Verilog/VHDL at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), down to the gate-level. Primary research areas are verification, debugging, and synthesis, all major problems in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). We heavily use the RISC-V ISA in our research work (see e.g. our open-source RISC-V VP).
